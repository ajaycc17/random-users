# Using random users API to list users

Here a delay of 1 second is used to have a visualisation of the spinner in work while the data loads. This is totally optional and can be removed.

## Development Environment

To run the code in development environment use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Data is fetched two times in Strict mode, bu tonly in development server. In production, strict mode is preferred and works fine.
